=head1 NAME

Test::File -- test file attributes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Test::File;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modules provides a collection of test utilities for
file attributes.

Some file attributes depend on the owner of the process testing
the file in the same way the file test operators do.

=head2 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item file_exists_ok( FILENAME [, NAME ] )

Ok if the file exists, and not ok otherwise.

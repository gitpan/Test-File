* added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the 
platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

* Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
on a Windows machine.

Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
files by their mode.

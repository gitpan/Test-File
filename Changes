1.31 - Tue Jan 24 12:37:14 PST 2012
	* Added some SKIP blocks to avoid test failures
	when running as root.  (D'oh!)

	* Added dir_exists_ok and dir_contains_ok
	* Added file_contains_like and file_contains_unlike
	* Fixed a few grammatical errors in POD

1.28 - Sun May 31 23:52:45 2009
	* Make the man pages after all

1.27 - Thu May 21 08:49:29 2009
	* Fix to the tests for 1.26 which didn't account for an
	extra setup test.

1.26 - Fri May 15 09:31:23 2009
	Don't create man pages for the module (RT #45977)

1.25_001 - Tue Jul 15 23:59:42 2008
	* Adding some symlink features, more later
	* Refactoring and separating many tests - test coverage at 90% now
	* This is really a test release for my new Module::Release

1.25 - Tue Jun 10 12:59:54 2008
	* Same as 1.24_03, but with a user release version number. The
	new features are the ones in 1.24, but this time the tests
	should all pass :)

1.24_03 - Sun May 25 21:52:48 2008
	* Make some adjustments in checking the error messages in
	test_files.t to make them work across platforms
	* Remove links.t from the distribution. It doesn't really
	test anything yet.

1.24_02 - Sun May 25 02:09:24 2008
	* Add a binmode before writing to files so they come out right
	on Windows. Stupid rookie mistake. :(

1.24_01 - Sat May 24 13:27:17 2008
	* Trial version to fix test ordering problem in 1.24
	* Removed setup.t, which turned into setup_common but wasn't updated
	for the new features in 1.24 (so files were missing in other test
	files)

1.24 - Tue May 20 21:59:19 2008
	* David Wheeler sent a patch to add file_line_count_is, so
	I also added file_line_count_isnt and file_line_count_between.
	* There aren't any other improvements, so you don't need to
	upgrade unless you want the new functions.

1.23 - Wed Apr 23 13:10:39 2008
	* [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is now fail if the owner or
	group does not exist.

1.22_01 - Sun Apr 20 14:58:41 2008
	* [BUG FIX] owner_is and group_is were passing with non-existent 
	users and groups. Now I check the arguments to see if they
	actually exist before I test. This is a developer release to let
	CPAN Testers take a whack at it first.

1.22 - Wed Oct 31 19:40:23 2007
	* fixed problem with file path separators in t/rt/30346.t
	* no need to upgrade if you were already able to install this

1.21 - Tue Oct 30 11:11:49 2007
	* Fix RT #30346 ( file_not_empty_ok passes if file doesn't exist)
	* require 5.006 from now on

1.19 - Sat Oct 27 20:53:47 2007
	* distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

1.18 - Tue Jan  9 22:48:14 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.17 - Fri Nov 24 14:30:05 2006
	* Updated tests for Test::More 0.65's change in error reporting
	* Added LICENSE field to docs
	* No need to upgrade it you already have this installed

1.16 - Sat Jul  8 15:38:38 2006
	* updated the plan for links.t to have the right number of tests
	* no need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.15 - Wed May 17 21:42:09 2006
	* Updated the distro for copyright and kwalitee. No need to upgrade.

1.14 - Wed Mar  8 12:36:22 2006
	* Added Dylan Martin's test for group_is and group_isnt
	* No need to upgrade unless you need these features

1.13 - Sat Dec 31 13:34:30 2005
	* You need the latest Test::Builder::Tester (0.32 right now) to get
	the owner.t test to pass. I've noted that in the PREREQ_PM.
	* You don't need to upgrade if you already have Test::File
	installed. If you run into a test problem, ensure you have
	the latest Test::Builder::Tester and try again.

1.12 - Sun Dec 25 18:02:58 2005
	* Added the tests owner_is() and owner_isnt() from Dylan Martin

1.11 - Sun Oct  2 05:42:41 2005
	* Some strings were mistakenly single-quoted. I meant to interpolate but
	didn't use double quotes. Should I lose my Perl license? :)

* Upgrade to get the interpolated error messages.

1.10 - Sun Jun  5 17:34:54 2005
	* Fixed Windows testing with patch from Tom Metro. Now that I have a
	Windows box, I don't need to guess on some of this stuff.
	* There is a minor code change, but you don't need to rush to upgrade
	if you already have an installed version.

1.09 - Tue Mar  8 17:58:28 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests: no need to upgrade

1.08 - Thu Jan  6 17:36:20 2005
	* added a patch from David Wheeler to canonicalize paths for the 
	platform.  If the paths look like unix paths, I split them on /
	and reconstruct them with File::Spec->catdir.

	* Some functions don't work with Win32, so I detect that inside
	those functions and automatically skip the test if I think I'm
	on a Windows machine.

1.07 - Mon Jan  3 17:12:51 2005
	Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
	funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
	files by their mode.

1.06 - Sun Sep  5 15:59:40 2004
	* Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root privileges, which 
	don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - Thu Sep  2 21:27:27 2004
	* fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
	* cleaned up the distribution a bit
	* You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

Shawn Sorichetti <ssoriche@coloredblocks.net> contributed two new
funtions: file_mode_is() and file_mode_isnt().  We can now test
files by their mode.

* Fixed tests that failed if you ran them with root priveleges, which 
don't actually completely depend on file permissions

1.05 - Thu Sep  2 21:27:27 2004
* fixed a documentation bug dealing with file sizes
* cleaned up the distribution a bit
* You don't need to upgrade if you already have this module

0.9 - Sun Jul  4 20:34:50 2004
* ported tests to Test::More
* cleaned up dist files, especially Makefile.PL
* fixed up some doc issues in File.pm
